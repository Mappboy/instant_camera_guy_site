I offer expert restoration and repair of Polaroid cameras. If your camera has an issue, I can probably fix it.

Some specific services I provide include:

## General repair job

Got a broken Polaroid camera? I can probably help! Estimates are free of charge and repair costs generally start at around $50 for box type cameras or $150 for SLR models

## Conversion of ALL SX-70 cameras to take 600 type film

Allows you to use 600 type film without the need for a filter!

## Reskinning SX-70 and SLR680 cameras with brand new LEATHER

I can also do custom decals and designs, such as rainbows etc
    price subject to materials and time taken.
    wood-grain skins for SX-70 cameras also available!

## General CLA

Polaroids can often have very dirty lenses or viewfinders if they have sat in the shed for too long. Improper storage can mean they spend years accumulating dust, fungus or insect debris. I can clean just about any Polaroid camera!

## Battery compartment modifications on the folding Automatic Land Cameras

Modification of vintage automatic camera to take AAA batteries

## Fitment of new lenses and shutters to Automatic Land Cameras

Broken lens or shutter? I can replace it!
    I can also customize your camera and install fully manual lenses and shutters!

## Conditions

_Please note that repaired cameras must be picked up within 3 months of works being completed. Uncollected cameras will be sold on or scrapped for parts to recoup costs as per Victorian Salvage Rights law._

_Please note that I do NOT service Fuji Instax cameras. These cameras are sadly designed to be easier to replace than repair, and are generally available brand new for less than I could charge to fix them._

## Warranty:

_All cameras I sell come with a 6 month warranty for all services performed to the camera. Should it fail, simply send it back to me and I will repair it without extra cost. Exceptions are in cases of physical or water damage, dead integrated circuits, failed reduction gears in the gear-train and user error resulting in mangled pick-arms. In cases where one of the aforementioned fails, critical spare parts will be required at additional cost, but will be supplied as cheaply as possible._
