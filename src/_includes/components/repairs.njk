<p class="text-gray-200 text-lg mt-10 w-2/4 text-center">Please note that I do NOT service Fuji Instax cameras. These cameras are sadly designed to be easier to replace than repair, and are generally available brand new for less than I could charge to fix them. Services include:</p>

<p class="prose-p:italics text-gray-200 text-lg mt-10 w-2/4 text-center"> All cameras I sell come with a 6 month warranty for all services performed to the camera.
    Should it fail, simply send it back to me and I will repair it without extra cost.
    Exceptions are in cases of physical or water damage, dead integrated circuits, failed reduction gears in the gear-train and user error resulting in mangled pick-arms. 
    In cases where one of the aforementioned fails, critical spare parts will be required at additional cost, but will be supplied as cheaply as possible.</p>
